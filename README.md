# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Testing the contract

```
npm test
```

`./test` holds all the test for each contract. 

See 
`./test/setupSerive.ts` 
for how the contracts are setup.

## Dev
Start local chain: 
```
npx hardhat node
```
